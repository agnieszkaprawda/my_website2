In this project we used data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere from [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

We will now load the file.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

We have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. We will use the `select()` function for this.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. We will use for that `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Thereafter, we will name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, we will name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather<-weather[,1:13]%>%
  pivot_longer(!Year,names_to="Month",values_to="delta")

tidyweather

```

Now we will inspect our dataframe. It has 3 variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(Year, Month, "1")),
          monthnr=month(ymd(date),label=FALSE), 
         Month=as.factor(Month))


ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

In the next step, we will try to answer the following question: 

>Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? 

For that we will use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>% 
    mutate(Month = factor(Month, 
                         levels = c("Jan", 
                                    "Feb", 
                                    "Mar", 
                                    "Apr", 
                                    "May",
                                    "Jun",
                                    "Jul",
                                    "Aug",
                                    "Sep",
                                    "Oct",
                                    "Nov",
                                    "Dec"))) 

ggplot(tidyweather,aes(x=date,y=delta, order=monthnr))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~Month)+
  labs(title="Weather Anomalies (by month)")+
  theme_bw()
```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

comparison

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. We will set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Throught the periods, the monthly temperaute deviation has raised.",
    subtitle= "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```
From the graph we can clearly see that the monthly anomalies have raised through time. 


So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we are also interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         

```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

We will now construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Please, recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval=="2011-present",
         Year!=2019)%>%
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(Year)%>%
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  summarise(delta_mean=mean(delta))%>%
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  summarise(total_mean=mean(delta_mean),
            sd=sd(delta_mean),
            count=n(),
            se=sd/sqrt(count),
            lower_95=total_mean-1.96*se, 
            upper_95=total_mean+1.96*se)%>%
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  summarise(confidence_interval=c(lower_95,
                                  upper_95))
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci

```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
bootstrap_ci <- comparison%>%
  filter(interval=="2011-present",
         Year!=2019)%>%
  specify(response=delta)%>%
  generate(reps=1000,
           type="bootstrap")%>%
  calculate(stat="mean")%>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile", 
         point_estimate = NULL)
comparison
bootstrap_ci
  
```

We first cleansed dataframe `weather` and converted it into long form (`tidyweather`). To increase relevance of analysis, we next removed all entries prior to 1880 and classified all the remaining rows into different year bundles ('comparison'). We then try to capture the average annual delta (with 95% confidence) by building a 95% confidence interval through two methods: by formula and by bootstrapping. From the CIs we obtain, we can say we are 95% confident that the true mean lies in proximity of our confidence intervals. Note however, for practical purposes the bootstrapping one would be more useful when predicting long term and general behaviour since it is narrower.
